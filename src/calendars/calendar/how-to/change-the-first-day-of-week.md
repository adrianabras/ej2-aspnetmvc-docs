# Change the first day of the week

The Calendar provides an option to change the first day of the week by using the [firstDayOfWeek](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Calendars.Calendar.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Calendars_Calendar_FirstDayOfWeek)
property. Generally, the day of the week starts from 0 (Sunday) and ends with 6 (Saturday).

> By default, the first day of the week is culture specific.

The following example shows the Calendar with `Tuesday` as the first day of the week.
