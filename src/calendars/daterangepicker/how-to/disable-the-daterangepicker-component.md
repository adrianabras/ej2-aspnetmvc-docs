# Disable the control

DateRangePicker can be inactivated on a page, by setting [enabled](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Calendars.DateRangePicker.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Calendars_DateRangePicker_Enabled) value as false that will disable the control completely from all the user interactions including in the form post. The following example demonstrates the disabled control.

{% aspTab template="daterangepicker/how-to/disable" %}

{% endaspTab %}
