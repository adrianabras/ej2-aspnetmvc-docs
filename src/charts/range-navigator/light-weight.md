# Lightweight range navigator

By default, when the dataSource for series property in RangeNavigator is empty, a light weight Range navigator will get
initialized without chart. The following code example shows the basic lightweight range navigator.

{% aspTab template="range-navigator/light-weight", sourceFiles="light-weight.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
