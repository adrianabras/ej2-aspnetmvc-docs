# Virtual Scrolling

Virtual Scroll support in Gantt allows you to load large amount of data without performance degradation. To enable Virtual Scrolling, you need to inject `VirtualScroll` module in Gantt.

## Row Virtualization

Row virtualization allows you to load and render a large number of tasks in Gantt with effective performance. In this mode, all tasks are fetched initially from the datasource and rendered in the DOM within a compact viewport area.

The number of records displayed in the Gantt is determined by the height.

This mode can be enable by setting the `EnableVirtualization` property to `true`.

{% aspTab template="gantt/virtual-scroll", sourceFiles="virtual-scroll.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Limitations for Virtual Scroll

* Due to the element height limitation in browsers, the maximum number of records loaded is limited by the browser capacity.
* Cell selection will not be persisted.
* The number of records rendered will be determined by the `Height` property.
* If the height property is not specified, the default number of task rendered is ten.
