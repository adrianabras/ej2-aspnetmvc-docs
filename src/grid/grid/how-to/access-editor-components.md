# Access Editor components

You can access the component instance from the component element using the **ej2_instances** property.

In the below demo, you can access the Editor component instance while adding or editing actions on the [`ActionComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionComplete) event.

{% aspTab template="grid/how-to/access-editor", sourceFiles="access-editor.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
