# Print the expanded state from other pages

By default, the expanded child grids will be printed from the current page alone. You can print the expanded child grids from other pages by using the [`Load`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_Load) and [`ActionBegin`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionBegin) event.

In the following example, we have printed expanded child grids form other pages.

{% aspTab template="grid/how-to/hierarchyprint", sourceFiles="hierarchyprint.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
