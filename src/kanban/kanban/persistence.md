# State Persistence

State persistence refers to the Kanban state maintained in the browser's [`LocalStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser.

State persistence stores Kanban datasource, column or swimlane expand/collapse state in the local storage when the `EnablePersistence` is defined as true.
