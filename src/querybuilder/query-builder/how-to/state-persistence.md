# State Persistence

State persistence allows you to maintain the current state in the browser’s `localStorage` even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. State persistence stores the Query Builder’s `Rule` object in the local storage when the `EnablePersistence` is defined to true.
