# Restrict the groups

You can restrict the groups by defining the `MaxGroupCount` property. By default, the value is 5. In the below demo, the `MaxGroupCount` is set to 2 .

{% aspTab template="query-builder/getting-started/demo", sourceFiles="default.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

> You can use this property in the mobile mode to restrict the nested group creation.
