# Customization

You can customize the  entire appearance of the input element and Calendar by using
custom
[cssClass](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Calendars.DatePicker.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Calendars_DatePicker_CssClass)
property.
and also you can use the calendar's
[renderDayCell](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Calendars.DatePicker.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Calendars_DatePicker_RenderDayCell)
event to customize the appearance of the each day cell.

Below is the list of classes that provides flexible way to customize the DatePicker component.
