# Customize icon and width

Width of the DropDownButton can be customized by setting required width to the dropdown element.

The following UI can be achieved by setting
[`iconPosition`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.SplitButtons.DropDownButton.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_SplitButtons_DropDownButton_IconPosition) as `Top`, width as `85px`
and size of the font icon as `40px` by adding `e-custom` class.
