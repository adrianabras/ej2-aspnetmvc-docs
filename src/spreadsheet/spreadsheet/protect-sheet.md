# Protection

Sheet protection helps you to prevent the users from modifying the data in the spreadsheet.

## Protect Sheet

Protect sheet feature helps you to prevent the unknown users from accidentally changing, editing, moving, or deleting data in a spreadsheet.
You can use the [`isProtected`](../api/spreadsheet/#isProtected) property to enable or disable the Protecting functionality.

> * The default value for `isProtected` property is `false`.

By default in protected sheet, selecting, formatting, inserting, deleting functionalities are disabled. To enable some of the above said functionalities
the `protectSettings` options are used in a protected spreadsheet.

The available `protectSettings` options in spreadsheet are,

| Options | Uses |
|-----|------|
| `Select Cells` | Used to perform Cell Selection. |
| `Format Cells` | Used to perform Cell formatting. |
| `Format Rows` | Used to perform Row formatting. |
| `Format Columns` | Used to perform Column formatting. |
| `Insert Link` | Used to perform Hyperlink Insertions. |

> * The default value for all `protectSettings` options are `false`.

By default, the `Protect Sheet` module is injected internally into the Spreadsheet to perform sheet protection function.

### User Interface

In the active Spreadsheet, the sheet protection can be done by any of the following ways:

* Select the Protect Sheet item in the Ribbon toolbar under the Data Tab, and then select your desired options.
* Right-click the sheet tab, select the Protect Sheet item in the context menu, and then select your desired options.
* Use the [`protectSheet()`](../api/spreadsheet/#protectSheet) method programmatically.

The following code example shows `Protect Sheet` functionality in the Spreadsheet control.

{% aspTab template="spreadsheet/protect-sheet", sourceFiles="protectSheetController.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Unprotect Sheet

Unprotect sheet is used to enable all the functionalities that are already disabled in a protected spreadsheet.

### User Interface

In the active Spreadsheet, the sheet Unprotection can be done by any of the following ways:

* Select the `Unprotect Sheet` item in the Ribbon toolbar under the Data Tab.
* Right-click the sheet tab, select the `Unprotect Sheet` item in the context menu.
* Use the [`unprotectSheet()`](../api/spreadsheet/#unprotectSheet) method programmatically.

## Unlock the particular cells in the protected sheet

In protected spreadsheet, to make some particular cell or range of cells are editable, you can use [`lockCells()`](../api/spreadsheet/#lockCells) method, with the parameter `range` and `isLocked` property as false.

{% aspTab template="spreadsheet/lock-cells", sourceFiles="lockCellController.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
