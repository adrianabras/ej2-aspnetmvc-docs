# Sort a range by custom list

You can also define the sorting of cell values based on your own customized personal list. In this article, custom list is achieved using `custom sort comparer`.

In the following demo, the `Trustworthiness` column is sorted based on the custom lists `Perfect`, `Sufficient`, and `Insufficient`.

{% aspTab template="spreadsheet/custom-sort", sourceFiles="customSortController.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
