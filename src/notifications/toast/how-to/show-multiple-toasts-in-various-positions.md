# Show multiple toasts in various positions

By default, the positions of the new toasts are only updated after the visible toasts have been destroyed. If You need to display multiple toasts with different positions, initiate another toasts.

The following sample demonstrates adding multiple toasts in different positions.

{% aspTab template="toast/multiple", sourceFiles="controller.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
