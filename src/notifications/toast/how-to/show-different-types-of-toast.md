# Show different types of toast

The Syncfusion ASP.NET Core toast has the following predefined styles that can be defined using the [`CssClass`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Notifications.Toast.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Notifications_Toast_CssClass) property for achieving different types of toast:

| Class | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| e-toast-success | Represents a positive toast |
| e-toast-info | Represents an informative toast |
| e-toast-warning | Represents a toast with caution |
| e-toast-danger | Represents a negative toast |
