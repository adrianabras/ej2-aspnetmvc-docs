# To keep single pane open always

By default, all Accordion panels are collapsible. You can customize the Accordion to keep one panel as expanded state always. This is applicable for `Single` expand mode.

{% aspTab template="accordion/how-to/openalways", sourceFiles="openalways.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
