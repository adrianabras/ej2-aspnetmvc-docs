# CustomValue

The MultiSelect allows user to add a new non-present option to the control value when [allowCustomValue](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.MultiSelect~AllowCustomValue.html) is enabled. while selecting the new custom value `customValueSelection` event will be triggered.

The following sample demonstrates configuration of custom value support with the MultiSelect control.

{% aspTab template="multiselect/custom-value", sourceFiles="customvalue.cs,gamelist.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
