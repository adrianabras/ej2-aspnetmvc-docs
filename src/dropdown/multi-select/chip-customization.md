# Chip Customization

The MultiSelect allows the user to customize the selected chip element through the [tagging](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.MultiSelect~Tagging.html) event. In that event, you can set the custom classes to chip element via that event argument of `setClass` method.

The following sample demonstrates chip-customization with the MultiSelect control.

{% aspTab template="multiselect/chip-customization", sourceFiles="customization.cs,gamelist.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
