# Enable Scroller

The ListBox supports scrolling and it can be achieved by restricting the height of the list box using [`height`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.ListBox~Height.html) property.

In the following sample, `height` of the list box is restricted to `250px`.

{% aspTab template="listbox/scroller", sourceFiles="scroller.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
