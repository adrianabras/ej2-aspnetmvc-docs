# Add item in between in DropDownList

You can add item in between based on item [index](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.DropDownList~Index.html). If you add new item without item index, item will be added as last item in list.

The following example demonstrate how to add item in between in DropDownList.

{% aspTab template="dropdownlist/how-to/additem", sourceFiles="additem.cs,GameList.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
