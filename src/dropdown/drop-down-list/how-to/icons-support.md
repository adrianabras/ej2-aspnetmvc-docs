[iconCss](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.DropDownListFieldSettings~IconCss.html) field. This `iconCss` field create a span in the list item with mapped class name
to allow styling as per your need.

{% aspTab template="dropdownlist/how-to/icons", sourceFiles="icons.cs,SocialMedia.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
