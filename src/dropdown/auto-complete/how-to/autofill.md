[autofill](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.AutoCompleteBuilder~AutoFill.html) property. Whenever you change the
input value, the AutoComplete will autocomplete your data by matching the typed
character. Suppose, if no matches found then, AutoComplete doesn't suggest any item.
