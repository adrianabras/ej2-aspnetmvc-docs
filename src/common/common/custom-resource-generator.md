## Search and select the control list

Search and select the required Syncfusion controls from the CRG to generate specific set of control resources.

The Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC UI controls can be categorized based on the below characteristics.

* Injectable module supported controls
* Injectable module non-supported controls

`Injectable module supported controls` are rendered as treeview with checkbox format and the `Injectable module non-supported controls` are rendered as normal checkbox format in the CRG application.

Refer to the following steps to search and select the controls in CRG.

1.	Navigate to the Custom Resource Generator (CRG) application at [`CRG`](https://crg.syncfusion.com/).

2.	Type the required control name in the search bar and select the check box. The dependency of the selected control is resolved in the application itself, so it does not need to choose each dependent control by manually.

## Import previously generated settings into the CRG

To add more controls or upgrade the latest Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC library resources, it is not necessary to generate it from the scratch in the CRG. Just import the old **settings.json** file and made the changes, then download it again from the CRG application.

Refer to the following steps to import previous settings in the CRG.

1.	Click the **IMPORT SETTINGS** button at the bottom of the page.
