# Overview

Theme Studio for Essential JS 2 can be used to customize a new theme from an existing theme. It doesn't support with Data visualization components like Chart, Diagram, Gauge, Range Navigator, Maps.

## Customizing theme color from theme studio

The Essential JS 2 themes are developed under the SCSS environment. Each theme has a unique common variable list. When you change the common variable color code value, it will reflect in all the Essential JS 2 components. All the Essential JS 2 component styles are derived from these [theme-based common variables](theme#common-variables).This common variable list is handled inside the theme studio application for customizing theme-based colors.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the theme studio application at [https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/).

**Step 2:** The theme studio application page can be divided into two sections: the components preview section on the left, and the theme customization section on the right.

### Filtering a specific list of components

Using the theme studio, you can apply custom themes to a list of specific components. This option is useful when you have integrated a selective list of Essential JS 2 components in your application. The theme studio will filter the selected components and customize the final output for those components’ styles alone, reducing the final output file size.

**Step 1:** Click the Filter icon in the top right corner and select the components whose theme you want to customize.

**Step 2:** Click the Apply button in the Filter dialog. Now, only the selected components will be rendered in the components preview section.

**Step 2:** Assign a theme name in the File Name field and click the Download button. If your application uses both Essential JS 1 and Essential JS 2 components, then select the Include compatibility css check box before downloading the theme. This option will generate the custom theme for Essential JS 2 compatibility styles, which are compatible as Essential JS 1 styles. Refer this [link](./../common/compatible-with-essentialjs1/) for more details about Essential JS 1 and Essential JS 2 compatibility.

**Step 3:** The download styles will come as a zip file that contains SCSS and CSS files for the selected Essential JS 2 components. The current settings are stored in the `settings.json` file.

### Using customized theme in a web application

You can directly use the customized CSS file in the web application.

**Step 1:** Copy/paste the customized CSS file from the download folder into your application at any folder. Example: `styles\{file-name}.css`.

**Step 2:** Refer the customized CSS file reference in the `index.html` or `shared/_layout.cshtml` main page head section.

```html
    <head>
        <link href="styles/{file-name}.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
```

> If you are using Essential JS 1 and Essential JS 2 components in a same web application, then you have to copy/paste the customized CSS file from the `compatibility` folder in the download location.

## Import previously changed settings into the theme studio

When you want to change your application theme and UI design in the future, you won’t need to customize the Essential JS 2 components from scratch in the theme studio. Just import the old `settings.json` file to review and update your stored settings in the theme studio application.

**Step 1:** Click the Import icon in the top right corner.
